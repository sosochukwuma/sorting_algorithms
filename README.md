##  C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

In this project shows,
-   At least four different sorting algorithms
-   What the Big O notation is, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
-   How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
-   What a stable sorting algorithm is

### While

-   Using `vi` editor
-   All files were compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   The programs and functions were compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the     flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
-   All files ended with a new line
-   Having a `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project
-   Using the `Betty` coding style
-   Not using global variables
-   Having no more than 5 functions per file
-   Not using the standard library, functions like _printf, puts, …_ except where specified otherwise
-   Including the prototypes of all functions in the header file `sort.h`
-   Don’t forget to push your header file
